Hackathon Problem Statement:
ACES Centralized Platform

Problem Statement:
The Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES) at our college currently lacks a centralized digital
platform to efficiently manage its members, events, and communication. Event planning, student directory
management, real-time announcements, and budget tracking are currently unstructured and inefficient.
Your task is to develop a web-based platform that will help ACES:
Manage committee members and student directory
Plan, track, and manage department events
Send real-time announcements and notifications
Track budgets and expenses for events
Key Features & Functionalities
1Ô∏è.Member & Student Directory
‚Ä¢ Add, update, and remove ACES committee members with their roles and photos.
‚Ä¢ Maintain a student directory for all Computer Department students.
‚Ä¢ Implement search and filter options based on year, skills, or name.
2Ô∏è. Event Management & Registration
‚Ä¢ Create, update, and track department events (Hackathons, Seminars, Tech Talks).
‚Ä¢ Provide an event registration system for students.
‚Ä¢ Implement QR-based check-in for event attendance tracking.
3Ô∏è. Real-time Announcements & Notifications
‚Ä¢ Develop a real-time announcement system for ACES updates.
‚Ä¢ Enable instant notifications for event updates and deadlines.
‚Ä¢ Implement a centralized dashboard for quick access to announcements.
4Ô∏è.Budget & Expense Tracking
‚Ä¢ Design a budget planning module for ACES events.
‚Ä¢ Implement a real-time expense tracker with data visualization.
‚Ä¢ Generate budget reports and insights to track expenses.
