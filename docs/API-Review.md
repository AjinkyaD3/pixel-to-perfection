## Issues and Recommendations

### 1. Missing API Documentation

Many endpoints in the routes and controllers are not documented in the API documentation. These need to be added for completeness:

- Authentication: 
  - `/auth/logout` 
  - `/auth/update-password`

- Events:
  - `/events/:id` (PUT, DELETE)
  - `/events/:id/qrcode`
  - `/events/analytics`
  - `/events/export`

- Students:
  - `/students/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - `/students/upload`
  - `/students/analytics`
  - `/students/export`

- Budgets:
  - `/budgets/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - `/budgets/:id/expenses` 
  - `/budgets/:id/expenses/:expenseId` (PUT, DELETE)
  - `/budgets/:id/expenses/:expenseId/approve`
  - `/budgets/analytics`
  - `/budgets/:id/export`

- Announcements:
  - `/announcements/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - `/announcements/:id/pin`
  - `/announcements/analytics`

### 2. Naming Inconsistencies

There's a naming mismatch between routes and controllers for:
- `/events/:id/checkin` route uses `checkInEvent` controller, but the controller method is named `checkIn`

### 3. Parameter Validation

The API documentation should explicitly mention all required parameters for each endpoint and match the validation in the routes.

### 4. API Base URL

The API documentation specifies `/v1` in the base URL, but the application code doesn't include this version prefix. This should be aligned for consistency.

## Conclusion

The codebase has a solid foundation with most core routes and controllers properly implemented. However, the API documentation requires significant updates to accurately reflect all available endpoints. I recommend updating the documentation to include all missing endpoints and ensuring parameter validation and naming are consistent throughout the codebase.
